    "paragraph": "Hi, I am Raif, a 26 years old located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. My interest has always been in Cyber Security. I want to ensure that security is our top priority within our quickly developing world and would like to contribute to a more secure environment. \n\nI like to keep myself relevant by solving Capture The Flags and following the latest IT developments. I also keep myself busy by listening to music, gaming and listening to podcasts like TedTalk. I would like to improve myself within the Cyber Security field in order to become the ultimate Penetration Tester. I always keep a close eye to newly discovered vulnerabilities and like to challenge myself with unsolved weaknesses. I am someone who wants to make the world a more secure place for the next generation, even if it goes unnoticed."
